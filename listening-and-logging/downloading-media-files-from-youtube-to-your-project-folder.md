# Downloading Media Files From YouTube to Your Project Folder

1. Go to [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and find the video you want to add to your project. Copy the URL.
2. Go to [https://ezmp3.cc/](https://ezmp3.cc/). Paste the URL of the YouTube video in the empty field. Click the **Convert** button.
3. When the site is done processing the YouTube video, click the **Download** button. **Note:** Do not click anything in the pop-up windows or new tabs that appear.
4. Click the **Save** button in the **Save As** box. The MP3 will download to your **Downloads** folder.
5. In your **Downloads** folder, rename the MP3. Be sure to maintain the .mp3 extension.&#x20;
6. Move the MP3 to your project folder. You may need to [open multiple Explorer windows](https://techresources.gitbook.io/file-and-folder-management-windows-edition/opening-multiple-explorer-windows) to do this.
