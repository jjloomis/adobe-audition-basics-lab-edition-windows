# Opening an Existing Multitrack Session

To continue working on an existing multitrack session, you'll open the SESX file in your project folder.

**Note**: When you open an existing multitrack session, only WAV files that have been added to audio tracks will appear in the **Files** panel \(upper-left.\)

To work with WAV files that were previously saved or copied to your project folder, you'll need to import those WAV files into your multitrack session.

1. [Navigate](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/file-and-folder-management/content/navigating-folder-tree.html) to and open your project folder. 
2. Double-click your SESX file to open your multitrack session. 
3. To continue working with previously saved WAV files that are in your project folder, [import the WAV files into Audition](https://jjloomis.gitbooks.io/adobe-audition-basic-audio-editing/content/listening-and-logging/importing-wav-files.html).
