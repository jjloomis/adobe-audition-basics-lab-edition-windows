# Preparing a Project for Transcription at Home

1. After [adding range markers to a WAV file](adding-range-markers-to-wav-file.md) in the **Waveform Editor**, go to **File** on the menu bar and select **Export** and then choose **File**.
2. In the **Export File** dialog box, click the **Format** drop-down list and choose **MP3 Audio (\*.mp3)**.
3. Click the **Browse** button and then navigate to and select the **Documents** folder.
4. Click the **OK** button. A warning box will appear. Click **Yes**.
5. Using your phone, take a **photo** of all of the **Range Markers** in the **Markers** tab. Be sure to include the **Start** and **End** times for all of the **Range Markers**.
6. In your **UWM email account**, compose an email to yourself. Add the **MP3** you exported in **Step 2** as an attachment. If a box appears asking if you'd like to **Upload and share as OneDrive link**, you may do so.
7. Listen to the **MP3** at your leisure. Use the **photo** from **Step 5** as a reference while transcribing the audio between the **Start** and **End** time of each **Range Marker** in the photo.
