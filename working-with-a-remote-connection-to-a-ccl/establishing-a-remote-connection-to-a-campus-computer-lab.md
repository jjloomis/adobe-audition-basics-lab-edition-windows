# Establishing a remote connection to a Campus Computer Lab

When you establish a remote connection to a Campus Computer Lab \(CCL\), you are creating a connection to a Windows computer \(PC\) no matter what type of computer you are using at home. For example, if you use a Mac to remotely connect to a CCL, you are connecting to a CCL PC. The same is true for Chromebooks and of course, PCs.

The instructions listed below the video are for the type of computer you are using at home \(you will always remotely connect to a PC.\)
