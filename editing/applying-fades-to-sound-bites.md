# Applying Fades to Sound Bites

As a general rule, every sound bite in a Multitrack Sesssion should have a slight fade applied to the beginning and end of it. This creates smooth transitions from sound bite to sound bite.

Note: Only apply fades to the sounds bites in your Multitrack Session. Fades created in the Waveform Editor are destructive and can't be changed after you exit Audition.

1. Select a sound bite in an audio track. The sound bite will appear highlighted.
2. In the upper left and right corners of the sound bite, youâ€™ll see small squares. These are the fade handles. \(Note: You may need to Zoom In if you are not seeing the fade handles.\)
3. Click and drag the fade handles to apply fades to the beginning and end of the sound bite.
4. Repeat this process for all of your sound bites.

Note: As you click and drag your fade handles, aim for a fade shape pictured on the sound bites below. The shape of a fade affects its speed and sound.
