# Creating a Google Account

A Google Account gives you access to Google Drive, YouTube, Google Analytics, and Gmail. Use your Google account credentials \(username and password\) to sign into all of these services.

You'll use your Google Account to [upload](https://github.com/jjloomis/adobe-audition-2020-basics-home-edition-windows/tree/ac14d28cc45c0945766293a8da05536ceb13f5f0/submitting-your-work/uploading-a-folder-to-google-drive.md) your project folder to Google Drive. Then you'll [create a shareable link](https://github.com/jjloomis/adobe-audition-2020-basics-home-edition-windows/tree/ac14d28cc45c0945766293a8da05536ceb13f5f0/submitting-your-work/uploading-a-folder-to-google-drive/creating-a-shareable-link-to-a-folder-on-google-drive.md) to that folder and send it to your instructor. \(**Note**: A project folder is too large to send as a compressed email attachment.\)
